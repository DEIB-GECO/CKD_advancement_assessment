 In this notebook an overview of the datased used for the study is provided. Together with it, we provide an example of the proposed computational model (an ExtraTreesClassifier) trained and tested for the different classification problems defiend in the study:

    - predicting dialysis within 1 year or after (binary classification)

    - predicting dialysis within the first 6 months, between 6 and 18 months, or after 18 months (3 classes)

    -  predicting the occurrence of renal failure within the first 6months, between 6 and 14 months, between 14 and 24 months, or more than 24 months (4 classes)

For brevity, in this Notebook the comparison of all the evaluated algorithms is omitted but the readers are welcome to try and compare different computational models (Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks, etc.) over different approaches (classification or regression) and different subsets of features. The details and results of the different approaches and models that have been compared in the study can be found in the original manuscript.
